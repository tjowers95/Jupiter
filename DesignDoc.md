## Problem

_**A lot of dating applications available today have developed reputations that limit the demographic**_ to first and second year college students (18-22). Beyond that age, many don't like to disclose the fact that they are on Tinder, Bumble, etc

_**No dating applications available today have addressed the anxiety associated with meeting a stranger**_, particularly in an online setting. We don't always bond with people well enough to date someone we met online. There is no oppurtunities to have a [Shared Emotional Experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sharing_of_emotions#Effect_on_relationships)

_**All dating applications available today provide minimal effort in assessing matches and guiding users**_ in the dating process. We're more confident meeting others when we believe we understand them and when we believe we understand ourselves we aren't less fearful of judgement. Also understanding what love is and the forms of love that are alleged to exist might make us more confident in the chase.

* **People need discretion**
* **People need to be pushed**
* **People need to be taught**
